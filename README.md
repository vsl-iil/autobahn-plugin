Allows you to set share limits for users. If they share less, they will be banned and/or warned. Users who share over a set limit will be added to a friend list. 
You can set messages that will be sent to users.

The original author expressed no intent in supporting the code; thus, I release it under CC0 and will try to develop the plugin and fix bugs.
